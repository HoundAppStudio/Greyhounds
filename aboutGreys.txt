Did you know the greyhound is one of the oldest breeds in history? These noble dogs have been traced back over 4,000 years to early cave drawings and are the only breed mentioned in the Bible. By giving a greyhound a home, you are taking on a true thoroughbred and a breed that has been “mans’ best friend” for thousands of years!
